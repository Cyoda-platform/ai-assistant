Hi! I‚Äôm Cyoda üßö and I‚Äôll be guiding you on your journey!

We‚Äôre currently in alpha, so you might run into a few bumps. No worries ‚Äî if you need help, just reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/95rdAyBZr2)!

Cyoda is entity-based ‚Äî each entity follows its own workflow.  
I'm also workflow-driven! To track progress, open the *Entities Data* window.

I‚Äôll be kicking off new workflows for you ‚Äî you‚Äôll see them appear in that window. Once a flow reaches the **locked** state, it‚Äôs done and dusted ‚úÖ.

Curious about what I can do? Just ask: **"Show me your agent tools."**

Have fun exploring!
