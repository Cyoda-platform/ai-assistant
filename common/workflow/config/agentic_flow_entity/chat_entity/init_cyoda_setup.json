                    "Step 1: Locate the `.env.template` file in your project root. Once found, rename it to `.env` and open it in a text editor.✅ Tip: Use your code editor’s file tree or terminal to confirm it's in the root directory.\n\n",
                    "Troubleshooting:\n- Can’t find `.env.template`? Make sure you’ve checked out the correct branch `{branch_name}`.\n- File still missing?\nCheck your `.gitignore`, or ensure the repo was cloned fully (with submodules if needed).",
                    "Step 2: Edit your new `.env` file with the required environment-specific values (API keys, GRPC host, ports, etc.).Tip: These values are often provided by your team or in project onboarding docs.",

                    "Troubleshooting:\n- `ModuleNotFoundError`?\nRun `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n- `quart` not found?\nInstall with `pip install quart`\n- Permission errors?\nTry running with `python3` instead of `python`.",

                    "Troubleshooting:\n- If the server crashes immediately, recheck your `.env` file values.\n- Use `print()` statements or a debugger to identify issues in `app.py`.",

                    "Troubleshooting:\n- GRPC connection failures?\nEnsure the `GRPC_HOST` and `GRPC_PORT` in your `.env` are correct.\n- If you're behind a proxy, verify outbound port access.",
                    "Step 6: With your env configured, it's time to import the workflows.\n\nDo you have your workflow files ready (e.g., .yaml or .json)?\nIf yes, import them now via the UI or CLI.",
                    "Troubleshooting:\n- If the import fails, verify the format and version of your workflow files.\n- Watch Cyoda Cloud logs for import errors.",
                    "Step 7: Now restart the application to ensure it connects to the Cyoda GRPC server properly.\n\nLet me know if the connection succeeds or if you hit any issues.",
                    "Troubleshooting:\n- On restart, check logs for any GRPC-related errors.\n- Missing workflow mappings can also cause silent failures—confirm setup.",
                    "Step 8: Let’s test your API.\n\nGo to http://localhost:5000 (or your configured port), and ensure everything looks good.",
                    "Troubleshooting:\n- Can't access the local server?\nCheck if the app is still running and if your firewall settings allow local traffic.",
                    "Step 9: Navigate to the route `routes/routes`.\n\nYou’ll find an endpoint called `add_entity` there.\nTry submitting an entity.\nOnce submitted, it should trigger a GRPC event that makes the data available in Cyoda.\n\n",
                    "Troubleshooting:\n- No event in Cyoda?\nEnsure the endpoint properly triggers GRPC and that workflow routing is correctly set.\n- Use logs to trace the request and confirm GRPC payload was sent."
