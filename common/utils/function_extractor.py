Below is one possible refactoring. In this approach the complete workflow is split into several helper functions that all start with process_ and take a single argument (the entity). Each function modifies the entity in‐place by storing intermediate results. The main workflow (process_companies_workflow) simply calls these steps sequentially while using try/except to catch any error and flag the entity as “failed.”

Note that in a real‐world situation you might choose to “return” intermediate values instead—but here we “decorate” the shared entity data so that every function adheres to the one-argument rule.

Workflow Explanation:

1. process_retrieve_payload: Retrieves and validates the payload from the entity.
2. process_prepare_api_request: Builds the API URL and the query parameters based on the payload.
3. process_call_external_api: Calls the external API with aiohttp. If the API call fails or returns a non-200 error, it logs the message.
4. process_filter_active_companies: Filters the companies to retain only those that are "active".
5. process_enrich_companies: Adds LEI information to each active company.
6. process_finalize_entity: Updates the entity to mark the workflow as successfully completed.

This modular approach keeps each step clear and testable while ensuring that every function only accepts the entity as its single parameter.
