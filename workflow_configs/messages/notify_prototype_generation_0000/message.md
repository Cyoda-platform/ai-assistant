🌟 Let’s kick off the first prototype! 🛠️

💡  Just a heads-up: this prototype is a **simulation of the application**.
- No Cyoda components will be running.
- No data persistence.
- The goal is to confirm the **business logic** and ensure you’re getting the expected results.

For now, please focus on:
✅ API endpoints and functional requirements  
✅ Simulated state machine behavior  
✅ Integrating with any external APIs (a perfect time to test these out!)

We’re not tackling non-functional requirements yet—this stage is all about getting the prototype right.

Let’s make this prototype work smoothly together! 🚀

It’ll be ready in about 10 minutes ⏳. I’ll notify you as soon as it’s done.

🚧 Initial prototype is now in progress... 🚀💡
