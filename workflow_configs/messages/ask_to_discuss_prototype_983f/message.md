✅ First Prototype Ready!

The initial prototype based on your functional requirements is now ready! You can run and test it locally or directly in **GitHub Codespaces**.

---

### ▶️ How to Run the Prototype

#### **Option 1: GitHub Codespaces **
You can open the repo in GitHub Codespaces and launch the prototype there:

1. Open the repository in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/Cyoda-platform/{repository_name}/tree/{git_branch}).
2. In the Codespace terminal, run:

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update
# Install Java 21 (headless — no GUI tools)
sudo apt install -y openjdk-21-jdk-headless
# Set Java 21 as active version
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
# Run the prototype app
./gradlew test --tests PrototypeApplicationTest
```

3. Make the app accessible from the browser:
 - In the **Ports** panel (bottom of the IDE), right-click on port `8080` and select **"Change Port Visibility" → "Public"**
 - Alternatively, after starting the app, click **"Make Public"** in the popup.

4. Preview the app in the browser:
 `/swagger-ui/index.html` - Swagger UI: `https://<your-codespace-url>/swagger-ui/index.html`
 - OpenAPI specification: `https://<your-codespace-url>/v3/api-docs`

> *Codespaces will provide a forwarded port URL — just append `/swagger-ui/index.html` or `/v3/api-docs` to it.*

#### **Option 2: Local Environment**

1. Make sure you're on the correct branch and up to date:

```bash
git checkout {git_branch}
git pull
```

2. Run the prototype app:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests PrototypeApplicationTest
```

3. Open your browser and go to:
- [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)
- or [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)

### 🧪 Testing

You'll find example requests and responses in:
📄 `prototype/functional_requirement.md`

Use these to test the API via the Swagger UI.
