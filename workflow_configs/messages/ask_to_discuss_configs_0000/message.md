✅ **Entity POJOs** and **workflow configurations** have been added to your application.

Entities can be found in the file 'src/main/java/com/java_template/application/entity/{EntityName}.java'.
Workflows can be found in the file 'src/main/java/com/java_template/application/workflow/{EntityName}.json'.

This event‑driven approach allows complex business logic to be defined declaratively and evolve through configuration instead of code changes.
 
For a detailed reference on workflow configuration, see the **[Cyoda Workflow Configuration Guide](https://docs.cyoda.net/#guides/workflow-config-guide)**. It explains:

• How to define states, transitions, and criteria  
• Manual vs automated transitions  
• Processor execution modes and best practices  
• Example workflows like "Payment Request Workflow" for real-world scenarios

You can preview workflows visually in the **“Open canvas”** view (upper-right corner of the UI).

Please review the generated entities and workflows in your `{git_branch}`.
