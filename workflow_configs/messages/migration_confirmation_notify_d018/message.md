🚀 **Let’s generate your application code!**

I’ll take care of everything — no need to lift a finger.

⏳ While the code is being generated (~10 min), feel free to grab a coffee ☕ and relax.

**Here’s what’s happening behind the scenes:**
- **Entity Design:** Defining JSON structures for your entities (`application/entity/*`)
- **Workflow Design:** Mapping transitions (`application/workflow/*`)
- **Workflow Processor:** Java logic that powers it all (`application/processor/*`, `application/criterion/*`)

🛠️ This step brings your app to life — from requirements to real, running code.

✅ I’ll notify you as soon as everything’s ready to review.
