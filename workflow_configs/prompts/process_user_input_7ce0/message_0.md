PROCESS USER RESPONSE TO CREDENTIALS QUESTION:
The user was previously asked if they want to get their M2M credentials (CYODA_CLIENT_ID and CYODA_CLIENT_SECRET) for OAuth2 flow.
You need to process their response to this question.

RESPONSE PROCESSING:
• If user gives POSITIVE response (yes, sure, okay, ok, please, go ahead, or any affirmative answer): IMMEDIATELY call ui_function_issue_technical_user tool with the required parameters.
• If user gives NEGATIVE response (no, not now, later, etc.): Acknowledge their choice and let them know they can ask for credentials anytime by saying 'get my credentials' or 'give me technical user'.
• If user asks about environment status instead: Use appropriate tools to check status (get_build_id_from_context, then get_env_deploy_status if build ID found, or get_user_info if no build ID).
• If user asks for build ID specifically: Use get_build_id_from_context tool first, then get_user_info tool if needed.

IMPORTANT:
• Do NOT ask about credentials again if user already gave a clear answer.
• If user says yes to credentials, call ui_function_issue_technical_user immediately - don't ask for confirmation again.
• Process the user's actual response, don't repeat previous questions.
CRITICAL: the user can redeploy the environment only in a separate chat. You do not have a tool to redeploy the environment.
• Positive responses include: 'yes', 'sure', 'okay', 'ok', 'please', 'go ahead', 'give me', 'I want', or any affirmative answer.
