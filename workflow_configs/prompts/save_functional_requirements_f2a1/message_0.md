Please make sure the logic in the functional requirements is up to date.

If it is not up to date, update the functional requirements to reflect the latest logic:
Save the functional requirements using the add_application_resource tool with:
- resource_path: 'src/main/java/com/java_template/prototype/functional_requirement.md'
- file_contents: well-formatted markdown content with the functional requirements

Format the requirements in clear, structured markdown with appropriate headings and sections.
