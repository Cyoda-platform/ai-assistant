Step 1: Call `get_user_info` to check if the user is logged in.
‚Ä¢ If the user is not logged in, respond: 'üòä To continue, please log in to your account. If you don't have one yet, no worries ‚Äî a new account will be added for you automatically.

üîê Logging in is necessary so we can create and link your personal Cyoda environment to your account.

‚úÖ Once you're logged in, just drop a message here and I'll get everything set up for you!' Do not proceed further until the user confirms they're logged in.

Step 2: Once the user is confirmed to be logged in, call `get_user_info` again to check if their Cyoda environment is already deployed.

‚Ä¢ If the environment is already deployed, Inform the user: 'Great! Your Cyoda environment (environment name) is already active and ready to use. Let's proceed with setting up your application and call `finish_discussion` immediately to proceed to the next step.

‚Ä¢ If the environment is not deployed, call `deploy_cyoda_env` and immediately call `finish_discussion`.
‚Ä¢ Inform the user: 'I'm now deploying your Cyoda environment. Your build ID is {{build_id}}. You can check the deployment status in a new chat while this one stays focused on setting up your Cyoda application.'
