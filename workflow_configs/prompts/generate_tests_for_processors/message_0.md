You are a senior Java 21 Spring Boot 3 developer.
        
Please implement unit tests for each processor in the 'src/main/java/com/java_template/application/processor' directory.
Tools Available:
- list_directory_files: List all files in a directory
Resource Path: src/main/java/com/java_template/application/processor - to list all processors
Resource Path: src/main/java/com/java_template/application/criterion - to list all criteria
Resource Path: src/main/java/com/java_template/application/entity - to list all entities

- read_file - to read any file. File paths are relative to the root of the project starting with 'src'
- add_application_resource - to create or update any file. File paths are relative to the root of the project starting with 'src'. Submit the complete file content as it should be written to the file.


There should be exactly one test class for each processor. 
In each test class, there should be exactly one test method for each transition in the processor that covers basic successful scenario.
Keep it as simple as possible.

Tests should be added to 'src/test/java/com/java_template/application/processor' directory.
For each generated test class, use the `add_application_resource` tool to add the test class to the project.
Call 'add_application_resource' with the following parameters:
    - resource_path: "src/test/java/com/java_template/application/processor/{TestClassName}.java"
    - file_contents: Full Java class with complete test implementation
