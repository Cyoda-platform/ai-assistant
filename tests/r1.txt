Hello! üëã I would like to develop an application that: 1. Ingests data from a specified data source üì• 2. Aggregates the data üßÆ 3. Saves the aggregated data to a report üìÑ Once the report is generated, the application should send it to the admin's email üìß. Additionally, the data ingestion process should be scheduled to run once a day ‚è∞


Let's expose endpoint
GET /report
POST /report

This will do:
1. Curl

curl -X GET "https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/Activities" -H  "accept: text/plain; v=1.0"
Request URL
https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/Activities
Server response
Code	Details
200
Response body

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Activity 1",
    "dueDate": "2025-02-10T22:55:28.3667842+00:00",
    "completed": false
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Activity 2",
    "dueDate": "2025-02-10T23:55:28.3667859+00:00",
    "completed": true
  },


then for each Activity

Curl

curl -X GET "https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/Activities/$id" -H  "accept: text/plain; v=1.0"
Request URL
https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/api/v1/Activities/1

{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Activity 1",
  "dueDate": "2025-02-10T22:56:42.2882278+00:00",
  "completed": false
}


combine to a single report and save to cache in json format (for each activity go and get its details) - save all to single report json to reports = []
