"""🌟 Getting Started with Initial Configurations 🛠️

I’ll generate the initial **Entity POJOs** and **Workflow Configurations** for you. You can review them in the **`{git_branch}`** branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cyoda-platform/{repository_name}/tree/{git_branch}) once they are ready.

---

### **Your New Configs**

**Entities** are the core business objects that represent real-world concepts like customers or orders. You'll find their Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) here:
`src/main/java/com/java_template/application/entity`

**Workflows** define the lifecycle of your entities. Each workflow is made up of:

* **States**: The stages an entity moves through (e.g., `Draft` → `Approved` → `Completed`).
* **Transitions**: The actions that move an entity between states.
* **Processors**: Custom logic that runs during a transition, such as sending notifications.

Your new workflow files will be available here:
`src/main/java/com/java_template/application/workflow`

### **Cyoda Handles the Boilerplate**

Cyoda takes care of all the state changes, triggers, queries, and history tracking for you. This frees you from boilerplate code and lets you focus entirely on your business logic.
