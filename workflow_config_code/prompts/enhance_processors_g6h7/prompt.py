Your task is to:

1. **Review All Generated Processors**: Examine all processor files that have been generated in the project
2. **Validate Business Logic Implementation**: Ensure all business logic from functional requirements is properly implemented
3. **Check External API Integration**: Verify that all required external APIs are properly integrated and called
4. **Identify Missing Functionality**: Find any gaps between functional requirements and actual implementation
5. **Generate Enhancement Report**: Create a comprehensive report with findings and recommendations

## Analysis Steps:

### 1. Discover Project Structure
- Use list_directory_files to explore the project structure
- Identify all processor files (typically in src/main/java/*/processor/ or similar)
- Read the functional requirements document if available

### 2. Review Each Processor
For each processor file:
- Read the complete file content
- Analyze the business logic implementation
- Check for proper error handling
- Verify external API calls and integrations
- Ensure proper data validation and transformation
- Check for security considerations

### 3. Cross-Reference with Requirements
- Compare implemented functionality with original functional requirements
- Identify missing business rules or logic
- Check if all user stories/use cases are covered
- Verify that all external systems mentioned in requirements are integrated

### 4. Technical Quality Assessment
- Check code quality and best practices
- Verify proper exception handling
- Ensure logging is implemented
- Check for performance considerations
- Validate security implementations

## Output Format:

Generate a detailed report in the following format:

```
# Processor Enhancement Analysis Report

### ❌ Missing or Incomplete Requirements
[List requirements that are missing or partially implemented]

## Technical Issues Found
### Critical Issues
[Issues that prevent proper functionality]

### Improvement Opportunities
[Areas for enhancement and optimization]

## External API Integration Status
[Status of all external API integrations]

## Recommendations for IDE/AI Assistant

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. [Specific action item 1]
2. [Specific action item 2]
...

### Enhancement Suggestions:
1. [Enhancement suggestion 1]
2. [Enhancement suggestion 2]
...

### Code Examples Needed:
[Specific code patterns or examples that should be implemented]

## Proposed Prompt for Local IDE/AI Assistant:

"Based on the analysis, please implement the following enhancements to the processors:

[Detailed, actionable prompt that can be used by local IDE or AI assistant to make the necessary improvements]

Focus on:
- [Specific areas to focus on]
- [Business logic gaps to fill]
- [External APIs to integrate]
- [Security considerations to implement]
"
```

## Important Guidelines:
- Be thorough and systematic in your analysis
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Include code examples where helpful
- Consider both functional and non-functional requirements
- Think about scalability, maintainability, and security
- Generate a prompt that can be directly used by developers or AI assistants

Remember: The goal is to ensure the generated processors fully implement all business requirements and are production-ready."""
