= How to Write a State Diagram with a Question Leading to Two Transitions
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

Mermaid is a popular syntax for drawing state diagrams to illustrate workflow logic. Below is an overview of how to write a state diagram that starts with a `question` node and branches into two transitions (one manual and one conditional) before proceeding to a final prompt.

== Diagram Overview

1. **Initial Start**
   Represented by `[*]`, indicating the entry point of your flow.

2. **State Nodes**
   Each state (e.g., `feedback_question`, `feedback_received`) is a distinct node. Arrows between these nodes represent transitions.

3. **Manual Transition**
   Involves a human-in-the-loop step. The diagram often labels such a transition with something like `(manual)` to indicate human intervention.

4. **Conditional Transition**
   Automatically moves to the next state when a condition function (e.g., `is_stage_completed`) is fulfilled.

5. **Final Prompt**
   The last or near-final state might include a prompt to confirm or summarize the interaction.

== Mermaid Syntax Explanation

- `stateDiagram-v2` : Tells Mermaid we are drawing a version 2 state diagram.
- `[ * ] --> someState` : Denotes an initial transition from the start node (`[*]`) to `someState`.
- `stateOne --> stateTwo : label` : Shows a transition from `stateOne` to `stateTwo` with a label describing either the transition name or additional details.
- Square brackets like `[condition]` can be used to note a guard or condition on the transition.
- `(manual)` or `(agent)` next to a transition’s label can give hints about what happens in that step (e.g., manual review vs. agent action).

== Example State Diagram

Below is the specific example diagram that includes a question state (`feedback_question`) branching into two different transitions from `feedback_received`:

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> start
    start --> feedback_question : notify_start / notification
    feedback_question --> feedback_received : collect_feedback / question
    feedback_received --> feedback_received : discuss_feedback (manual) / agent
    feedback_received --> processed : transition_to_feedback_processing_success [is_stage_completed] / agent
    processed --> workflow_completed : save_feedback / prompt
    workflow_completed --> end : notify_completion / notification
    end --> [*]
----

=== Explanation of Each Transition

1. `[ * ] --> start`
   - The diagram begins at a pseudo-state (`[*]`) and immediately transitions to the `start` state.

2. `start --> feedback_question : notify_start / notification`
   - Moves from `start` to `feedback_question`.
   - The label `notify_start / notification` suggests an action to notify users that the feedback process has begun.

3. `feedback_question --> feedback_received : collect_feedback / question`
   - Goes to `feedback_received` via `collect_feedback`.
   - The `question` label indicates this is where the user’s initial feedback is captured.

4. `feedback_received --> feedback_received : discuss_feedback (manual) / agent`
   - A manual transition labeled `(manual)`, indicating a human-in-the-loop step.
   - The `/ agent` part implies an agent action is triggered, but a human decides whether to continue or seek further details.

5. `feedback_received --> processed : transition_to_feedback_processing_success [is_stage_completed] / agent`
   - A conditional transition (guarded by `[is_stage_completed]`) that moves to `processed` if the condition is satisfied.
   - Another agent action is involved (`/ agent`), typically performing automated checks or actions (e.g., analysis functions).

6. `processed --> workflow_completed : save_feedback / prompt`
   - After processing, the workflow transitions to `workflow_completed` and the label indicates a `prompt` is shown to the user, often asking for final confirmation or a summary.

7. `workflow_completed --> end : notify_completion / notification`
   - The final notification occurs, signaling completion of the workflow.
   - The diagram returns to `end`, and from there, it terminates with `[ * ]`.

== Best Practices

1. **Clear Labels**
   - Each transition label should describe what event triggers the transition (e.g., `collect_feedback`) and what type of action it is (e.g., `/ question`, `/ agent`).

2. **Manual vs. Conditional**
   - Distinguish manual transitions (`(manual)`) from automated ones to highlight where human intervention is required versus where the system handles logic on its own.

3. **Consistent Naming**
   - Keep function or transition names consistent across your diagram and workflow configuration (e.g., using the same name `is_stage_completed` or `set_additional_question_flag` as in your implementation).

4. **Color or Style (Optional)**
   - Mermaid allows styling nodes and edges if clarity is needed. However, simple, clear labeling typically suffices for many workflows.

== Summary

When writing a state diagram for a workflow involving a question state branching into both manual and conditional transitions:

- Start from `[*]` and proceed to the first actionable state.
- Label transitions with meaningful names plus a slash (`/`) referencing their action type (`question`, `agent`, or `prompt`).
- Use `(manual)` for human-in-the-loop steps and `[condition]` syntax to indicate automated checks.
- Ensure a closing transition leads the diagram back to an `[*]` or an `end` state for a neat finish.

This approach offers a clear visual representation of how feedback flows, when humans intervene, and how automation proceeds, all within a concise Mermaid diagram.

Here is an example state diagram for agentic app workflow.

source state --> next state : transition name (manual - optional) /action[question, notification, agent, function, prompt]  [additional information about action in arbitrary format, for agents and functions it makes sense to specify tool names or function name that can be used with a list of parameters]. : is a reserved symbol — do not use it inside the brackets or values]

Human-in-the-loop Pattern Notice:

To implement a human-in-the-loop, first use a question action. Then, from the same source state, define two transitions:

A manual agent transition using the set_additional_question_flag tool.

A condition transition using is_stage_completed.
