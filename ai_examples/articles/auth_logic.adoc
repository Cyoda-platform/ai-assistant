== Overview

This document explains how we manage two types of users: *Guest Users* and *Signed-In Users*. It covers session handling, guest token rate limiting, chat migration upon sign-up, and UX best practices.

== User Types

=== 1. Guest Users

==== Session Initialization

When a guest user accesses the application, the following flow occurs:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Opens App] --> B[Frontend Requests Guest Token]
    B --> C[Backend Issues Guest Token]
    C --> D[Token Identifies Device / IP]
```

*Token Characteristics:*

- Perpetual (no expiration or refresh)
- Non-secure (not used for authorization)
- Used to identify the physical device or user

==== Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse such as multiple incognito sessions:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Request for Guest Token] --> B{Token Rate Limit Exceeded?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Reject Request]
    B -- No --> D[Issue Token]
```

*Rate limiting is based on:*

- IP address
- Device/user heuristics (e.g., user-agent, fingerprinting)

==== Chat and Workflow Restrictions

Guest users have the following limitations:

- Limited number of chat sessions
- Cannot access certain workflows (e.g., Cyoda environment deployment)

==== Design Goals

1. Identify physical users (via persistent guest token)
2. Enforce user-level rate limits to prevent abuse

=== 2. Signed-In Users

==== Transition from Guest to Signed-In

When a user signs up:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Guest User Signs Up] --> B[Guest Token Replaced with Auth0 Token]
    B --> C[One-Time Guest Chat Transfer]
```

- Guest token is replaced with an Auth0 secure token.
- A one-time chat migration occurs to retain conversation history.

==== One-Time Chat Transfer

Chat transfer occurs only *once* at sign-up.

Reasons for one-time migration:

- ✅ Maintains data integrity (avoids duplicates or corrupted states)
- ✅ Ensures a consistent user experience
- ✅ Prevents leakage of anonymous session data
- ✅ Follows industry best practices (e.g., ChatGPT does not support transferring anonymous sessions)

== UX & Communication Gaps

Currently, the UI does not clearly distinguish whether the user is in a *guest* or *signed-in* state.

=== Recommendations

- Display clear visual indicators of session status.
- Notify users when chats are migrated at sign-up.
- Ensure session separation is obvious and intuitive.

== Summary Table

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Guest Users | Signed-In Users

| Token Type | Perpetual guest token | Auth0 secure token
| Purpose | Identification only | Authentication + Identification
| Rate Limiting | Yes (IP & heuristics) | No
| Chat Access | Limited | Full
| Workflow Access | Restricted (e.g., no Cyoda deployment) | Full access
| Chat Migration | One-time only | Not repeated
| Session Clarity (UX) | Needs improvement | Should be clear
|===

== Best Practices

* Allow only *one-time chat transfer* upon sign-up.
* Do not allow repeat migrations from guest sessions.
* Keep *anonymous and authenticated sessions* separated clearly.
* Improve session visibility through *strong UI cues*.
* Follow industry conventions (e.g., ChatGPT behavior).
