Functional Requirements:
Fetching Data:

The system must fetch NBA game score data daily at a scheduled time.
Data will be fetched from the external API with the following configuration:
API Endpoint: GET https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba/scores/json/ScoresBasicFinal/{today}?key=test
The today parameter will follow the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-03-25).
The system should handle the request and response asynchronously.
Data Storage:

The system must save the fetched data locally to persist the scores of the games.
The database should include game details such as date, team names, score, and other relevant information.
Subscription System:

Users must be able to subscribe with their email to receive daily notifications with the latest NBA scores.
Upon subscription, the user will be added to the systemâ€™s notification list.
Notification System:

After fetching and storing the scores, the system should send an email notification to all subscribers with the daily NBA scores.
Notifications will include a summary of all games played on that specific day.
API Endpoints: The system will expose the following APIs:

POST /subscribe
Allows users to subscribe to daily notifications via email.
Request Body: { "email": "user@example.com" }
GET /subscribers
Retrieves a list of all subscribed email addresses.
GET /games/all
Retrieves all NBA games data stored in the system (optional filtering and pagination as needed).
GET /games/{date}
Retrieves all NBA games for a specific date.
date parameter should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Scheduler:

A background scheduler will fetch the NBA score data every day at a specified time (e.g., 6:00 PM UTC) without requiring an API call.
The scheduler will trigger a process to fetch and store the data from the API, and after that, it will send email notifications to subscribers.
