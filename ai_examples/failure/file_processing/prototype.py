# Here’s the fully functioning `prototype.py` implementation that includes a single job endpoint for downloading, loading, and analyzing data, as well as a GET endpoint to retrieve the cached analysis results. The implementation uses local cache without any external persistence methods:
#
# ```python
from quart import Quart, request, jsonify
from quart_schema import QuartSchema
import aiohttp
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

app = Quart(__name__)
QuartSchema(app)

# Local cache for storing downloaded data and analysis results
local_cache = {}

@app.route('/api/job', methods=['POST'])
async def job_endpoint():
    data = await request.get_json()
    url = data.get('url')

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            if response.status == 200:
                content = await response.text()
                # Store the CSV content in local cache
                local_cache['csv_data'] = content

                # Load data into DataFrame
                csv_data = StringIO(content)
                df = pd.read_csv(csv_data)

                # Store the DataFrame and perform analysis
                local_cache['dataframe'] = df

                # Perform analysis
                results = {}
                results['average_price'] = df['Price (£)'].mean()  # Calculate average price
                results['property_distribution'] = df['Property Type'].value_counts().to_dict()  # Property type distribution
                results['summary_statistics'] = df.describe(include='all').to_dict()  # Summary statistics

                # Store analysis results in local cache
                local_cache['analysis_results'] = results

                return jsonify({
                    "status": "success",
                    "message": "Job completed successfully.",
                    "results": results
                }), 200
            else:
                return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "Failed to download file."}), 400

@app.route('/api/report', methods=['GET'])
async def get_report():
    if 'analysis_results' not in local_cache:
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "No analysis results available."}), 404

    # Retrieve analysis results from local cache
    report = {
        "status": "success",
        "average_price": local_cache['analysis_results']['average_price'],
        "property_distribution": local_cache['analysis_results']['property_distribution'],
        "summary_statistics": local_cache['analysis_results']['summary_statistics'],
        "message": "Report retrieved successfully."
    }

    return jsonify(report), 200

    app.run(use_reloader=False, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, threaded=True)
# ```
#
# ### Key Features:
# - **Job Endpoint**: The `/api/job` POST endpoint handles:
#   - Downloading the CSV file from the provided URL.
#   - Loading the data into a pandas DataFrame.
#   - Performing analysis to calculate the average price, property distribution, and summary statistics.
#   - Storing the results in a local cache for later retrieval.
#
# - **Report Endpoint**: The `/api/report` GET endpoint retrieves the stored analysis results from the local cache and formats them for output.
#
# - **Local Cache**: All data is stored in memory, without any external persistence methods or databases.
#
# - **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented for failed downloads and when results are not available.
#
# This prototype should meet your requirements and allow you to verify the user experience while identifying additional needs or gaps before proceeding with a more comprehensive implementation.
