A simple API or a web interface could be developed.\n\n6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging for tracking API requests and user interactions for troubleshooting and improving the application.\n\n7. **Scalability**: Ensure that the architecture allows for scaling as the user base grows.\n\nIf these align with your vision, we can continue refining these requirements or explore additional features you may want to include.",

Is it global, national, or specific to certain cities?\n3. Are there any specific data sources or APIs you plan to use for retrieving weather data?\n4. What type of user interactions do you envision? Will users access it via a web interface, mobile app, or another method?\n5. Do you require any user authentication or personalization features?\n6.

This includes current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy).\n\n2. **Forecasting**: The application should provide weather forecasts for the next few days, allowing users to view upcoming weather conditions.\n\n3. **Geolocation Support**: Users should be able to enter a location (city or coordinates) to retrieve weather data specific to that area.\n\n4. **Alerts and Notifications**: The application should have the capability to send alerts for severe weather conditions, such as storms or extreme temperatures.\n\n5. **User Interface**: While not a functional requirement, consider how users will interact with the application. A simple API or a web interface could be developed.\n\n6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging for tracking API requests and user interactions for troubleshooting and improving the application.\n\n7. **Scalability**: Ensure that the architecture allows for scaling as the user base grows.\n\nIf these align with your vision, we can continue refining these requirements or explore additional features you may want to include."
