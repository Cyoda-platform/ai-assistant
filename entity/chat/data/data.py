### Setup Instructions for Your Application

Your application is ready! Please follow the steps below to configure it:

1. **Move the `.env.template` to `.env`**:
    Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`:
    ```bash
    mv .env.template .env
    ```

2. **Update the `.env` file**:
    Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual environment variables and credentials. For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.

    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.

3. **Start Your Application**:
    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    or just run the app.py in your IDE.
Please also update your api.py files to use cyoda_token until authentication featute is fully implemented. Sorry for inconvenience!
Your application should now be up and running! üéâ

You can check the api with http://localhost:5000/scalar

üéâ **Chat flow has been saved!** üéâ

The chat flow has been successfully saved to `entity/chat.json`. Now you can run `app.py` to start the application. üöÄ

Once you run it, both the **workflow** and **entities** will be imported to the Cyoda environment automatically. üåü

Any updates or changes to the entities will trigger the workflow, so you‚Äôre all set to go! üîÑ

Awesome! Let's dive into generating your application code! üöÄ 

I'll keep you updated with notifications on my progress, and let you know when it's time to discuss any changes.
 
Feel free to grab a coffee ‚òï while I work‚Äîit's going to take about 2 minutes. 
 
Just relax and wait for the update!

In this process, we will walk through each stage of building an application, from gathering initial requirements to designing, coding, and implementing the final logic.

### The stages of the process are as follows:

1. **Application design**:  
   Let's design the application using diagrams and chat. You'll receive a text document with the PRD as the output.  
   *Output documents*: entity/app_design.md

2. **Entities design**:  
   Let's define the JSON data structure for each entity.
   *Output documents*: entity/*

3. **Workflow design**:  
   Let's ensure our entity workflow is correctly defined.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/workflow.json

4. **Workflow processors code design**:  
   Let's implement the workflow processors.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/workflow.py

5. **Additional logic code design**:  
   Let's develop any additional business logic.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/api.py or entity/*/logic.py

---

### Process Flow:

Gathering requirements --> **Application design** --> **Entities design** --> **Workflow design** --> **Workflow processors code design** --> **Additional logic code design**

For each entity specify how it should be saved - through the workflow of a different entity (ENTITY_EVENT, SECONDARY_DATA) or directly via an API call or maybe via scheduler.
For an orchestration entity (if there is any) consider adding a single workflow per app. If there is no orchestration entity - then add workflow to any entity where it makes sense.
***For each workflow let's provide a flowchart***

Thanks for the go-ahead!
There are many ways to structure systems. We suggest using **event-driven design** with **entities** and **state machines**. This approach has proven to work exceptionally well for **high-availability** and **data-intensive** applications, ensuring scalability and simplicity.

### What are **Entities**? ü§î
Entities are **data units** that represent real-world objects. Each entity has a **lifecycle**, **states**, and **transitions** that define how it evolves over time.

### Our Approach: üí°
- **Entities** represent things like a **Light Bulb** üí°.
- **State Machines** visualize the **lifecycle** of entities (states + transitions) üîÑ.
- **Event-Driven Architecture** triggers actions based on events, making systems responsive and scalable ‚ö°.

### Simple Light Bulb Example üí°:
- **States**:  
  - **OFF** üö´  
  - **ON** ‚úÖ

- **Transitions**:  
  - **New** ‚Üí OFF (initial state)  
  - **Flip Switch** ‚Üí ON  
  - **Flip Switch Again** ‚Üí OFF
---

### Light Bulb Flowchart:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> OFF
    OFF --> ON : Flip Switch
    ON --> OFF : Flip Switch Again

We are currently generating templates for your data ingestion entities! üéâ Once I‚Äôm done, you‚Äôll find each entity in a separate folder: `entity/{entity_name}/{entity_name}.json`. üóÇÔ∏è
Also you‚Äôll find connection folder for each entity where we'll configure code for the data ingestion: `entity/{entity_name}/connections/connection.py`. üóÇÔ∏è

This file will represent the **entity model** as semi-structured data (think of it as an example). For data ingestion, this model should either be:
- **A golden JSON**: The raw data output from your data source, or
- **A transformed version**: In which case, we‚Äôll automatically handle the mapping for you! üîÑ

For now, we just need you to either:
- **Provide your own data example**, or
- **Approve our example** if it works for you! üëç Once you‚Äôre happy with it, we can move forward!

If everything looks good, just give us a thumbs up! üëç

### Setup Instructions for Your Application

Your application is ready! Please follow the steps below to configure it:

1. **Move the `.env.template` to `.env`**:
    Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`:
    ```bash
    mv .env.template .env
    ```

2. **Update the `.env` file**:
    Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual environment variables and credentials. For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.

    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.

3. **Start Your Application**:
    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    or just run the app.py in your IDE.

Your application should now be up and running! üéâ

You can check the api with http://localhost:5000/scalar
