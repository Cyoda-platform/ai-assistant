**While we work on your app design, let me quickly introduce Cyoda...** üòÑ

**Simplify My Work-Life! üòÖ**

Most databases only store and retrieve data, but if I want to do more, I need many other tools. More tools = more complexity! üò¨ I prefer simpler systems with fewer parts that fit together. But as tech improves, systems get harder to connect. üòï

I love creating things that work quickly. So, how can we simplify? ü§î Systems really only do three things:
1. Take in information üì®
2. Change, delete, or create info üîÑ
3. Make info accessible üîç

But we need **information**‚Äînot just data! üìö

Most systems need a database. But let‚Äôs go beyond storage and process data too. Think of it as a "smart" database that does more! üòé

**Entities Make It Easier!**  
We don‚Äôt think in tables or numbers‚Äîwe think in real-world things! ü§î A database should focus on **entities**‚Äîthings that have a start, middle, and end, like orders or payments. These entities change over time and follow rules, like a workflow. ‚è≥

**Why Entity State Machines are Great!**  
Viewing data as "entities" makes it easier to understand and use. It‚Äôs like mapping out real-life processes. üîÑ And you can change things without breaking the system. üí™

**The Entity Database (EDBMS)**  
An EDBMS keeps everything simple by managing processes and rules inside the database. It‚Äôs like having a smart assistant for your business. üòé Great for industries like healthcare, manufacturing, or customer management, where data and processes are tightly linked.

Let‚Äôs build better, simpler systems! üöÄ

**On Entity Workflows and How an EDBMS Leads to a Horizontally Scalable Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**

In a previous article, we introduced the Entity Database (EDBMS). Now, let‚Äôs dive into how an EDBMS leads to a simpler, horizontally scalable event-driven architecture (EDA), where applications become ‚Äúthin clients‚Äù with fewer moving parts and a smaller codebase. üòé

### Entity Workflow
An Entity Workflow includes:
1. **States**: The logical status of an entity (e.g., LOCKED, UNLOCKED).
2. **Transitions**: Pathways allowing an entity to change from one state to another.
3. **Predicates**: Conditions or rules that decide if a transition can happen.
4. **Actions**: Events triggered by transitions.

### Example: Careful Turnstile
A turnstile can have states like LOCKED and UNLOCKED. When a coin is added, it transitions to UNLOCKED. We can add actions to lock or unlock the turnstile based on the state. üîí

#### Automating Transitions
We can automate transitions based on safety checks, like ensuring it's safe to pass before unlocking the turnstile. This makes the workflow smarter and more automated. ü§ñ

#### Adding More Features
You can further enhance workflows by adding states like OFFLINE or controlling status lights. By adding predicates and actions, we can easily update the turnstile‚Äôs behavior as needed. üö¶

### Workflow Diagram
Here‚Äôs a textual depiction of the turnstile workflow:

None --> New --> LOCKED --> Coin --> UNLOCKED --> Coin --> LOCKED

- The flow starts at **None** when the turnstile is first created.
- Then, it transitions to **LOCKED** via the **New** transition.
- From **LOCKED**, inserting a **Coin** moves it to **UNLOCKED**.
- From **UNLOCKED**, pressing the **Push** button brings it back to **LOCKED**.
- Inserting a **Coin** again when it's **LOCKED** keeps it in a loop between **LOCKED** and **UNLOCKED**.

### Why This Works
Entity workflows are intuitive and iterative. They break complex tasks into smaller, manageable actions and rules that can be reused, making systems more adaptable to change and easier to maintain. üîÑ
