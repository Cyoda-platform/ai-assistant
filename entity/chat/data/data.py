To get started:

1. **Clone the repository** using the following command:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Cyoda-platform/quart-client-template/` 🚀

2. **Checkout your branch** using:  
   `git checkout {chat_id}` 🔄

You can access your branch directly on GitHub here: [Cyoda Platform GitHub](https://github.com/Cyoda-platform/quart-client-template/tree/{chat_id}) 😄

This repository is a **starter template** for your app and has two main modules:

- **Common Module**: This is all about integration with Cyoda! You don’t need to edit it unless you want to – it’s all done for you! 🎉  
- **Entity Module**: This is where your business logic and custom files will go. We'll add your files here, and you can track your progress. 📈 Feel free to **add or edit** anything in the Entity module. I’ll be pulling changes now and then, so just push your updates to let me know! 🚀

You can ask **questions in the chat** or in your project files anytime. When I make changes, I’ll let you know, and you can simply **pull** to sync with me! 🔄💬

Happy coding! 😄🎉"""

🎉 **Chat flow has been saved!** 🎉

The chat flow has been successfully saved to `entity/chat.json`. Now you can run `app.py` to start the application. 🚀

Once you run it, both the **workflow** and **entities** will be imported to the Cyoda environment automatically. 🌟

Any updates or changes to the entities will trigger the workflow, so you’re all set to go! 🔄

We are available in the **Google Tech Channel** to support you. If you spot any bugs or need additional features, feel free to submit tickets at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Cyoda-platform/ai-assistant). You’re also most welcome to contribute to the project! 💻

Awesome! Let's dive into generating your application code! 🚀 

I'll keep you updated with notifications on my progress, and let you know when it's time to discuss any changes.
 
Feel free to grab a coffee ☕ while I work—it's going to take about 2 minutes. 
 
Just relax and wait for the update!

In this process, we will walk through each stage of building an application, from gathering initial requirements to designing, coding, and implementing the final logic.

### The stages of the process are as follows:

1. **Application design**:  
   Let's design the application using diagrams and chat. You'll receive a text document with the PRD as the output.  
   *Output documents*: entity/app_design.md

2. **Entities design**:  
   Let's define the JSON data structure for each entity.
   *Output documents*: entity/*

3. **Workflow design**:  
   Let's ensure our entity workflow is correctly defined.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/workflow.json

4. **Workflow processors code design**:  
   Let's implement the workflow processors.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/workflow.py

5. **Additional logic code design**:  
   Let's develop any additional business logic.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/api.py or entity/*/logic.py

### Process Flow:

Gathering requirements --> **Application design** --> **Entities design** --> **Workflow design** --> **Workflow processors code design** --> **Additional logic code design**

Thanks for the go-ahead!
There are many ways to structure systems. We suggest using **event-driven design** with **entities** and **state machines**. This approach has proven to work exceptionally well for **high-availability** and **data-intensive** applications, ensuring scalability and simplicity.

### What are **Entities**? 🤔
Entities are **data units** that represent real-world objects. Each entity has a **lifecycle**, **states**, and **transitions** that define how it evolves over time.

### Our Approach: 💡
- **Entities** represent things like a **Light Bulb** 💡.
- **State Machines** visualize the **lifecycle** of entities (states + transitions) 🔄.
- **Event-Driven Architecture** triggers actions based on events, making systems responsive and scalable ⚡.

### Simple Light Bulb Example 💡:
- **States**:  
  - **OFF** 🚫  
  - **ON** ✅

- **Transitions**:  
  - **New** → OFF (initial state)  
  - **Flip Switch** → ON  
  - **Flip Switch Again** → OFF
---

### Light Bulb Flowchart:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> OFF
    OFF --> ON : Flip Switch
    ON --> OFF : Flip Switch Again
```    
🎉 Let’s dive into creating your project’s **entities** and **workflow** to build a scalable and data-intensive system!

We are currently generating templates for your data ingestion entities! 🎉 Once I’m done, you’ll find each entity in a separate folder: `entity/{entity_name}/{entity_name}.json`. 🗂️
Also you’ll find connection folder for each entity where we'll configure code for the data ingestion: `entity/{entity_name}/connections/connection.py`. 🗂️

This file will represent the **entity model** as semi-structured data (think of it as an example). For data ingestion, this model should either be:
- **A golden JSON**: The raw data output from your data source, or
- **A transformed version**: In which case, we’ll automatically handle the mapping for you! 🔄

For now, we just need you to either:
- **Provide your own data example**, or
- **Approve our example** if it works for you! 👍 Once you’re happy with it, we can move forward!

If everything looks good, just give us a thumbs up! 👍  
If you want to make any changes, feel free to edit the file in your IDE and **push the changes** so I can fetch them. Or, you can edit the models directly here, and I’ll save them for you! ✏️

Also, feel free to use **Canvas** to collaborate and edit the models together! 🖌️😊

Looking forward to your feedback! 🌟
