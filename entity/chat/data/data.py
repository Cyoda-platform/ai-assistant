### Setup Instructions for Your Application

Your application is ready! Please fetch the changes and follow the steps below to configure it:

1. **Move the `.env.template` to `.env`**:
    Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`:
    ```bash
    mv .env.template .env
    ```

2. **Update the `.env` file**:
    Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual environment variables and credentials. For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.

    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.

3. **Start Your Application**:
    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    or just run the app.py in your IDE.
Please also update your api.py files to use cyoda_token until authentication featute is fully implemented. Sorry for inconvenience!
Your application should now be up and running! üéâ

You can check the api with http://localhost:8000/scalar

üéâ **Chat flow has been saved!** üéâ

The chat flow has been successfully saved to `entity/chat.json`. Now you can run `app.py` to start the application. üöÄ

Once you run it, both the **workflow** and **entities** will be imported to the Cyoda environment automatically. üåü

Any updates or changes to the entities will trigger the workflow, so you‚Äôre all set to go! üîÑ

You are provided with a Python codebase that implements a REST API (using a framework like Quart, Flask, etc.). Currently, the code uses local in‚Äëmemory dictionaries (and counters) to store and manage data for one or more entity types. Your task is to refactor the code so that all interactions with the local cache are replaced by calls to an external service called entity_service (from app_init.app_init import entity_service).

For each entity type (represented by the placeholder {entity_name}), perform the following replacements:

Creating a new entity (typically via a POST endpoint):
Before: The code validates the input and adds the new entity to a local dictionary, using a counter to generate an ID.
After: Replace that logic with a call to:
entity_service.add_item(
    token=token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,  # always use this constant
    entity=data  # the validated data object
)
Retrieving a single entity (typically via a GET endpoint with an ID):
Before: The code retrieves the entity from the local dictionary.
After: Replace that logic with:
entity_service.get_item(
    token=token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,
    technical_id=<id>
)
Make sure <id> corresponds to the identifier extracted from the request.
Retrieving all entities (typically via a GET endpoint without an ID):
Before: The code returns the list of all entities stored in the local dictionary.
After: Replace that with a call to:
entity_service.get_items(
    token=token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,
)
Updating and Deleting entities:
ignore this for now
Cleanup:
Notes:
Assume that token and ENTITY_VERSION are defined and available in the scope.
Preserve the endpoint routes and any other essential business logic.
Remove all comments. No comments should be left.

Thanks for the go-ahead! We have fully composed our requirement. Now let's take a look at the architecture design for it.
There are many ways to structure systems. We suggest using **event-driven design** with **entities** and **state machines**. This approach has proven to work exceptionally well for **high-availability** and **data-intensive** applications, ensuring scalability and simplicity.

### What are **Entities**? ü§î
Entities are **data units** that represent real-world objects. Each entity has a **lifecycle**, **states**, and **transitions** that define how it evolves over time.

### Our Approach: üí°
- **Entities** represent things like a **Light Bulb** üí°.
- **State Machines** visualize the **lifecycle** of entities (states + transitions) üîÑ.
- **Event-Driven Architecture** triggers actions based on events, making systems responsive and scalable ‚ö°.

### Simple Light Bulb Example üí°:
- **States**:  
  - **OFF** üö´  
  - **ON** ‚úÖ

- **Transitions**:  
  - **New** ‚Üí OFF (initial state)  
  - **Flip Switch** ‚Üí ON  
  - **Flip Switch Again** ‚Üí OFF

### Light Bulb Flowchart:

Let's dive into generating your application code! üöÄ 

I'll keep you updated with notifications on my progress, and let you know when it's time to discuss any changes.

Feel free to grab a coffee ‚òï while I work‚Äîit's going to take about 2 minutes. 

Just relax and wait for the update!

In this process, we will walk through each stage of building an application, from gathering initial requirements to designing, coding, and implementing the final logic.

### The stages of the process are as follows:


   **Entities design**:  
   Let's define the JSON data structure for each entity.
   *Output documents*: entity/*

   **Workflow design**:  
   Let's ensure our entity workflow is correctly defined.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/workflow.json

   **Workflow processors code design**:  
   Let's implement the workflow processors.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/workflow.py

   **Additional logic code design**:  
   Let's develop any additional business logic.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/api.py or entity/*/logic.py

### Process Flow:

Gathering requirements --> Application design --> **Entities design** --> **Workflow design** --> **Workflow processors code design** --> **Additional logic code design**

Congratulations on successfully completing your application prototype!ü•≥
 
You‚Äôve put in a lot of hard work to bring your idea to life, and it‚Äôs truly exciting to see it in action. 

ü™Öü™Öü™ÖThis is an important milestone‚Äîwell done!ü™Öü™Öü™Ö

However, as impressive as your prototype is, it‚Äôs not yet fully robust. A few critical components are missing:

**Scalability and High Availability**

**Persistence and Data Integrity**

**Production-Ready Features**

To address these gaps and ensure your application can handle real-world demands, we recommend refactoring your solution using the Cyoda Framework. By deploying to a High Availability (HA) cluster on Cyoda Cloud, you‚Äôll benefit from:

**Enterprise-grade reliability and failover capabilities**

**Seamless data persistence**

**Streamlined deployment and scaling processes**

**A comprehensive set of production-ready tools and services**

We believe this transformation will empower your application to reach its full potential. Would you like to proceed with refactoring your prototype to make it robust, production-ready, and fully deployable on Cyoda Cloud?

Just give me a thumbs up! üëç

You're building a backend application. Currently you are focusing on functional requirements,

Let's analyse this request for application building, and clarify any important functional requirements 
that necessary.
Ask questions if something is not clear enough and make suggestions that will help us formulate formal specification in the next iterations. 
Make sure your answers are friendly but up-to-the point and do not start with any exclamations, but rather answer the question.
